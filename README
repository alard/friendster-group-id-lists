These lists contain the group ids of Friendster groups with at least
100 members, based on the list that I collected using Friendster search.

Note: I am still downloading the list of groups in categories 20 and 26,
so the current list of ids contains only a subset of the groups.

The category ids refer to the ids used by Friendster:
